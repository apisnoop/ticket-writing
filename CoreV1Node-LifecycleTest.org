** Untested Endpoints

According to following APIsnoop query, there are two Node endpoints that are untested.

#+NAME: untested_stable_core_endpoints
#+begin_src sql-mode :eval never-export :exports both :session none
select   endpoint,
         path,
         kind
from     testing.untested_stable_endpoint
where    eligible is true
and      endpoint ilike '%V1Node'
order by kind, endpoint
limit    10;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: untested_stable_core_endpoints

Scenario: Test the lifecycle of a Node

  Given the e2e test has created the settings for a Node
  When the test creates the Node
  Then the requested action is accepted without any error
  And the test confirms the name of the created Node

  Given the e2e test has created a Node
  When the test reads the Node
  Then the requested action is accepted without any error
  And the test confirms the name of the Node

  Given the e2e test has read a Node
  When the test patches the Node with a label
  Then the requested action is accepted without any error
  And the test confirms that the "patched" label is found

  Given the e2e test has patched a Node and created a "patched" LabelSelector
  When the test lists the Node with a "patched" labelSelector
  Then the requested action is accepted without any error
  And the retrieved list has a single item

  Given the e2e test has listed the Node
  When the test updates the Node with a label
  Then the requested action is accepted without any error
  And the test confirms that the "updated" label is found

  Given the e2e test has created a "updated" LabelSelector for the Node
  When the test deletes the Node
  Then the requested action is accepted without any error

  Given the e2e test has deleted the Node
  When the test lists for the Node with a "updated" labelSelector
  Then the requested action is accepted without any error
  And the deletion of the Node is confirmed

* E2E Test                                                              :export:

Using a number of existing e2e test practices a new [[https://github.com/ii/kubernetes/blob/create-node-lifecycle-test/test/e2e/node/create.go#L46-L129][ginkgo test]] has been created to provide future Conformance coverage for the 2 endpoints.
The e2e logs for this test are listed below.

** Listing endpoints hit by the new e2e test

This query shows the following Node endpoints are hit within a short period of running this e2e test.

#+begin_src sql-mode :eval never-export :exports both :session none
select distinct substring(endpoint from '\w+') AS endpoint,
                right(useragent,42) AS useragent
from  testing.audit_event
where useragent like 'e2e%should%'
  and release_date::BIGINT > round(((EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM NOW()))::numeric)*1000,0) - 20000
  and endpoint ilike '%Node%'
order by endpoint
limit 10;

* Final notes                                                           :export:

If a test with these calls gets merged, *test coverage will go up by 2 points*

This test is also created with the goal of conformance promotion.
