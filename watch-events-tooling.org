* Ticket status
- [ ] [[https://github.com/cncf/apisnoop/pull/323][K8s watch events test tooling #323]] 
- [ ] [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/90574][Watch event test verification tooling #90574]] 

* Current problem

Watch events may be missed and the test may still pass.
We need to ensure that all expected watch events are seen.

Watch events are not collected and checked at the end of the test.

* Proposed solution

In order to solve the problem, we must collect all watch events as they come in and perform a check at the end of the test to ensure that the order is correct and they contain no errors.
