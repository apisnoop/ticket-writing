** Untested Endpoints

According to following APIsnoop query, there are six VolumeAttachment endpoints that are untested.

#+begin_src sql-mode :eval never-export :exports both :session none
select   endpoint,
         path,

and      endpoint ilike '%VolumeAttachment'
order by kind, endpoint
limit    10;

Scenario: Test the lifecycle of a VolumeAttachment

  Given the e2e test has created the settings for a VolumeAttachment
  When the test creates the VolumeAttachment
  Then the requested action is accepted without any error
  And the test confirms the name of the created VolumeAttachment

  Given the e2e test has created a VolumeAttachment
  When the test reads the VolumeAttachment
  Then the requested action is accepted without any error
  And the test confirms the name of the read VolumeAttachment

  Given the e2e test has read a VolumeAttachment
  When the test patches the VolumeAttachment with a label
  Then the requested action is accepted without any error
  And the test confirms that the "patched" label is found

  Given the e2e test has patched a VolumeAttachment and created a "patched" LabelSelector
  When the test lists the VolumeAttachment with a "patched" labelSelector
  Then the requested action is accepted without any error
  And the retrieved list has a single item

  Given the e2e test has listed the VolumeAttachment
  When the test deletes the VolumeAttachment
  Then the requested action is accepted without any error

  Given the e2e test has deleted the VolumeAttachment
  When the test lists for the VolumeAttachment with a "patched" labelSelector
  Then the requested action is accepted without any error
  And the deletion of the VolumeAttachment is confirmed

  Given the e2e test has no VolumeAttachment
  When the test recreates a new VolumeAttachment
  Then the requested action is accepted without any error

  Given the e2e test has created a replacement VolumeAttachment
  When the test updates the VolumeAttachment with a label
  Then the requested action is accepted without any error
  And the test confirms that the "updated" label is found

  Given the e2e test has created a "updated" LabelSelector for the VolumeAttachment
  When the test applies the deleteCollection action with a "updated" labelSelector
  Then the requested action is accepted without any error

  Given the e2e test has deleted the VolumeAttachment
  When the test lists for the VolumeAttachment with a "updated" labelSelector
  Then the requested action is accepted without any error
  And the deletion of the VolumeAttachment is confirmed

* E2E Test                                                           :export:

Using a number of existing e2e test practices a new [[https://github.com/ii/kubernetes/blob/create-volume-attachment-lifecycle-test/test/e2e/storage/volume_attachment.go#L44-L159][ginkgo test]] has been created to provide future Conformance coverage for the 7 endpoints.
The e2e logs for this test are listed below.

If a test with these calls gets merged, *test coverage will go up by 7 points*

This test is also created with the goal of conformance promotion.
